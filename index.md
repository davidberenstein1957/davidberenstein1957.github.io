# Me, myself and I

From failing to study medicine ➡️ BSc industrial engineer ➡️ MSc computer scientist.

Life can be strange, so better enjoy it.

I´m sure I do by 👨🏽‍🍳 Cooking, 👨🏽‍💻 Coding, 🏆 Committing.

I currently work on open-source NLP at [✨Argilla](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla/): the open-source data curation platform for LLMs.
